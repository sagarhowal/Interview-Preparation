This repo is still in progress. This is a collection for all you might need to brush up on your Coding Interview for a Software Engineer Job skills





``` python
# This Code repositroy is for implementation and testing of various Data Structures & Algorithms
# Along with concepts you require for your Software Engineering Interview.
# If you stumble upon this notebook, please suggest any improvements or additions.
# This exercise(s) is based loosely on the coding interview university GitHub repo by John Washam:
# https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university
# 
# The goal of this notebook is to act as quick revision for all you learn for 
# your ocding interviews.
